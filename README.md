## About
Creating a simple bullet-hell shooter using JavaFX. Super basic right now, with a ton of ironing out to do.
No configuration, so expect a lot of hardcoding for testing.

## Features
- Player level-up system
- Enemies with programmable paths and shooting patterns
- Enemy and boss health bars
- A main menu!
- Probably poor program design

## Controls
- ↑, ↓, ←, → : Move
- Z: Shoot
- Shift: Slow down
- Tab: Open/Close debug window
- Esc: Pause
- Space: Spawn an enemy

## Future Implementation
- Player health/lives
- Levels
- Enemy spawn conditions (timeline/queue system)
- Various sprites
- Making the Entity class more intuitive
- Refining enemy path and shooting functionality
